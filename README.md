# Grimoire-Skeleton

Grimoire-Skeleton was a stripped down and barebones version of the main loop I was using in an old personal project. It contains a dedicated render thread with frame synchronization and a deterministic lockstep impl. This loop was created with 2D games in mind. This is now considered acrhived/legacy code.
